# Upload Flow Changes

## ✅ **What Changed**

### **Before (Old Flow):**
1. User selects file
2. File uploads to Supabase storage
3. Document record created with status "processing"
4. AI API immediately called to generate study materials
5. ❌ **Failed with "Free tier limit exceeded"**

### **After (New Flow):**
1. User selects file  
2. File uploads to Supabase storage
3. Document record created with status "uploaded"
4. ✅ **Upload completes successfully**
5. 🎯 **AI processing happens later when user chooses to generate study materials**

## 🔧 **Key Benefits**

- **No more free tier limit errors during upload**
- **Faster upload experience** - no waiting for AI processing
- **Users can save multiple documents** without hitting limits
- **Study material generation is on-demand** - only when needed
- **Better separation of concerns** - storage vs. processing

## 📱 **UI Changes**

- Button text changed from "Upload & Generate Study Materials" to "Save Document"
- Progress shows "Uploading Document" instead of "Processing Document"
- Removed processing status and AI-related messaging
- Added hint: "Generate study materials after saving"

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

You'll need to add functionality elsewhere in your app to:

1. **List saved documents** with their upload status
2. **Generate study materials button** for each document
3. **Call the AI API** when users want to create flashcards/quizzes
4. **Show processing status** during AI generation (separate from upload)

## 📋 **Database Status Values**

- `uploaded` - File saved, ready for processing
- `processing` - AI is generating study materials  
- `completed` - Study materials generated successfully
- `error` - AI processing failed

This change makes the upload flow much more reliable and user-friendly!
